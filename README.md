## Overview

Hello and welcome to my Mandalorian RPG game!

This game features four characters from the series and they're pitted against each other in this RPG style game. First step is to choose which fighter you would like to use. Each fighter has three attributes, Health(HP), Attack Power(AP), and Counter Attack Power(CAP). All these attribute values are different for each character. 

After choosing your fighter, the game will then ask you to choose an opponent. Once the opponent is chosen the attack phase will start. You'll hit the attack button to reduce the opponents HP and the opponent will counter attack to reduce yours. The HP of each character is always displayed but the AP and CAP are not until you hit the attack button. A small popup will inform the user of the values.

Every attack will increase your fighters AP by the initial amount. Once the opponent's HP reaches <1 they are defeated you can choose your next one. Your AP will not change after defeating an opponent and will continue to rise with each attack. If your HP reaches <1 (even at the same attack as the opponent's reaching <1) you will lose and the attack button will turn into a restart button.

Defeating all three opponents wins the game and changes the attack button into a restart button to reload the page. Good luck and "I have spoken".
